The Student Helpdesk was a new system introduced in 2018 to a university with 30,000 students and 4,000 staff. The aim was to provide support via an online helpdesk.
The system was a .net web app built by a supplier. But work was needed to customise the front-end and enhance the user experience. HTML, CSS and Javascript was utilised to optimise the system for the university and students.
