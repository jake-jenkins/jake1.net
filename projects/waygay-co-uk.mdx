WayGay.co.uk was the online home to a vibrant community of LGBTQ people posting over 100,000 messages in a support community. WayGay enjoyed significant usage and loyalty from the user base along with national recognition for its innovative peer support forums. In addition to support from university LGBT groups and the National Union of Students, WayGay was also funded by the National Lottery. Since social media has become so widely used and accepted WayGay has closed its doors.
